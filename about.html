<p>Hi, my name is Josh Stivers and I’m a local songwriter and guitarist from the Austin/San Antonio area.
</p>

<p>I’ve been writing and recording at studios in Texas for over 15 years. During that time, I’ve worked with many terrific musicians and I’ve seen first hand how much care and craftsmanship goes into creating great locally based music. Musical artists that continue to try to operate in this new paradigm face new challenges where essentially, consumers no longer feel that music should be paid for. Record companies work now in a distributing and marketing capacity only and artists are expected to bring a finished and fully produced product to their doorstep!</p>

<p>Please join me in supporting local artists like <a href="http://www.brandonsotomusic.com/about-brandon-soto.php" target="_blank">Brandon Soto</a> and <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/chad-overman/214354083 target="_blank">Chad Overman</a> by purchasing their music directly or through a third party like itunes. This allows for 100% original and local music to continue to be made. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
